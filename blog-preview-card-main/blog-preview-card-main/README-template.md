## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I focused on improving my HTML and CSS skills. I learned how to make the design responsive and used semantic tags for better accessibility. I also worked with font sizes to ensure readability across different devices.


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to dive deeper into CSS Grid and Flexbox to handle more complex layouts. I also want to focus on making designs more accessible and performant.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand how to use Flexbox effectively for this project.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - MDN is always a great resource for learning about HTML and CSS fundamentals.
