## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I focused on improving my HTML and CSS skills. I learned how to make the design responsive and used semantic tags for better accessibility. I also worked with font sizes to ensure readability across different devices.

Here's an example of some HTML code Iâ€™m proud of:

```html
<section class="card">
  <img src="./images/qr-code.png" alt="QR Code" class="qr-code" />
  <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
  <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level.</p>
</section>
```

And here's a CSS snippet that helped achieve a clean, responsive design:

```css
.card {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 15px;
  padding: 20px;
  max-width: 300px;
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to dive deeper into CSS Grid and Flexbox to handle more complex layouts. I also want to focus on making designs more accessible and performant.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand how to use Flexbox effectively for this project.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - MDN is always a great resource for learning about HTML and CSS fundamentals.
